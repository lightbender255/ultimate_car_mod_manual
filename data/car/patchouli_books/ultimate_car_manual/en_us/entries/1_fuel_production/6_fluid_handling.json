To prevent mixing of different fluids, you can use filters in fluid extractors.$(br2)For filters, you have to gather one bucket of the specific fluid. To apply a filter, you can place a bucket (filled with the specific fluid you want to filter) in the slot of the fluid extractor (Right-click the fluid extractor to see the slot).$(br2) The split tank will output two different fluids. One is biodiesel, which we can collect in a tank or directly output to a fuel station. The other is glycerin, which for now, is useless but has to be collected in a tank to make the split tank process go on.$(br2)With enough fuel produced, you can craft a generator powered with biodiesel. The generator is far more efficient than the dynamo. You can supply the generator directly with biodiesel from a fluid pipe or with a canister."
